This code is for an ESP8266 microcontroller, which is used to monitor and transmit electrical measurements from several PZEM-004T energy monitoring modules. Hereâ€™s a concise explanation of each part of the code:

### Libraries Imported
- **ESP8266WiFi.h**: Manages Wi-Fi connectivity.
- **WiFiClient.h**: Provides the client interface for communicating over the internet.
- **ESP8266WebServer.h**: Supports creating a web server (not utilized in this snippet).
- **ESP8266HTTPClient.h**: Handles HTTP requests.
- **PZEM004Tv30.h**: Interacts with the PZEM-004T energy monitoring device.
- **Wire.h**: Manages I2C communication (not specifically used in this code).

### PZEM Instances
Five instances of the `PZEM004Tv30` class are created (pzem to pzem4), each connected to different GPIO pins (D1 to D10) for measuring electrical parameters like voltage, current, power, energy, frequency, and power factor.

### Wi-Fi Credentials
The Wi-Fi SSID and password are defined using `#define`, allowing the code to connect to a specified Wi-Fi network.

### `setup()` Function
1. Initializes the serial communication at 9600 baud.
2. Sets the built-in LED to OUTPUT.
3. Initiates a connection to Wi-Fi using the provided credentials.
4. Displays connection status and the assigned local IP address.
5. Controls the built-in LED to signal the connection state.

### `loop()` Function
1. **Check Wi-Fi Connection**: The function continues only if connected to Wi-Fi.
2. **HTTP Client Initialization**: Creates instances for making HTTP requests.
3. **Data Retrieval**: 
   - Uses the `PZEM004T` instances to read voltage, current, power, energy, frequency, and power factor from each connected energy monitor.
   - These measurements are stored in floating-point variables (e.g., `voltage1`, `current1`, etc.).
4. **Data Preparation**: Converts the measured values into strings for easy transmission.
5. **Construct POST Data**: Constructs a URL-encoded string (`postData`) containing all measured values for transmission.
6. **HTTP POST Request**:
   - Initializes an HTTP connection to a specified PHP script on a web server.
   - Sets the content type to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
   - Sends a POST request with the prepared data.
   - Retrieves and prints the HTTP response code and payload for debugging.
7. **End Connection and Delay**: Closes the HTTP connection and introduces a delay of 7 seconds before the next loop iteration (ensuring not to flood the server with requests).

### Summary
The primary function of this code is to connect to a Wi-Fi network, continuously read electrical parameters from five PZEM-004T modules, format these readings into a POST request, and send them to a specified server URL for data logging or processing. Each loop iteration allows for a data transmission every 7 seconds, which helps in monitoring energy consumption.


This PHP script is designed to collect data from an ESP32 device via a POST request and insert that data into a MySQL database. Below is a clear, concise explanation of the different parts of the code:

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Database Connection Parameters**:
   - The script sets up database connection parameters including the server name (`localhost`), username (`pgcresearch_gaja`), password (`Gaja@123`), and database name (`pgcresearch_newiot`).

2. **Creating Database Connection**:
   - It creates a new MySQLi object (`$conn`) to connect to the MySQL database using the provided parameters.

3. **Checking the Connection**:
   - The script checks if the connection was successful. If there is an error, it terminates the execution (`die`) and outputs an error message.

4. **Handling Incoming Data**:
   - The script checks if the request method is POST (`$_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST"`), which indicates that data has been sent from the ESP32.
   - It retrieves various measurements (voltage, current, power, frequency, power factor, and energy) for five channels (1 through 5) from the POST data. Each measurement is stored in a variable, such as `$Voltage1post`, `$Current1post`, etc.

5. **Inserting Data into the Database**:
   - The script constructs an SQL `INSERT` statement to add the collected data into a table called `RegaIllamHall2`. The values for each measurement are included in the SQL command.
   - After constructing the SQL query, it executes the query using `$conn->query($sql)`.

6. **Feedback on Insertion**:
   - If the data is inserted successfully, it echoes a success message. If there is an error during insertion, it outputs the SQL error message.

7. **Closing the Database Connection**:
   - Finally, the script closes the database connection using `$conn->close()` to free up resources.

### Summary
- This PHP script receives measurement data from an ESP32 device via an HTTP POST request, connects to a MySQL database, stores the data in a specified table, and provides feedback on whether the data insertion was successful or if an error occurred. 

### Security Consideration
- **SQL Injection Risk**: The current implementation directly uses user input in SQL queries, which can lead to SQL injection attacks. It is recommended to use prepared statements to mitigate this risk.Avoid hardcoding sensitive data like usernames and passwords in production environments; instead, consider using environment variables or secure configuration files.
